Geolocator Tool
---------------------------------------

Problem:
- I always wondered how common my home address is... if only there
was a way to display similar addresses in other states/countries on
a map visually.

Requirements:
- Create a map that centers on the user's location (Toronto)
- Create a basic searchbar that turns the address into latitude/longitude coordinates
- Using the query results' coordinates, place a marker on each location
- For each marker, add a popup dialogue that displays the mailing details
- Clear the map each time the user queries for another address.
